# Kotlin FTC

My personal Kotlin library for FTC. This library contains everything under the sun for FTC programming. Is is designed
to be used as part of the [FTC SDK](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController), which you will note is
included as a part of this repository. This is done to simplify the process of getting started, interested in utilizing
Kotlin for FTC? Well this may not be the best place to start, but I hope it helps.
